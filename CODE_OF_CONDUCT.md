# Community Code of Conduct

## Preamble
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by this project, including but not limited to: GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, community chat groups (such as Discord/WeChat), mailing lists, offline events, etc.

We are committed to fostering an open, inclusive, and friendly community environment. All participants, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religious belief, technical expertise, or geographical background, deserve respect and equal treatment.

## Expected Behavior
- Respect the viewpoints and opinions of others. Even in the event of disagreement, communicate in a rational and peaceful manner.
- Focus on problem-solving rather than personal attacks or blame.
- Proactively help newcomers, share your experience and knowledge, and grow together.
- Be inclusive of different technical implementations, encouraging innovation and experimentation.
- Provide timely feedback on issues you discover, along with constructive suggestions for improvement.
- Protect others' privacy and do not disclose others' non-public information without permission.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Any form of personal attack, harassment, trolling, insult, threat, or intimidation.
- Discriminatory speech or behavior based on age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, etc.
- Posting vulgar, pornographic, violent, or illegal content.
- Malicious spamming, flooding, or posting irrelevant junk information.
- Unauthorized tampering or malicious submission of code or documentation that damages the project.
- Harassing, stalking others, or creating an uncomfortable atmosphere within the community.

## Enforcement Process
1.  **Reporting**: If you witness a violation, you may report it via email (xxx@xxx.com) or by direct message to a core maintainer. Please include relevant evidence (e.g., screenshots, links) with your report.
2.  **Response**:
    - Core maintainers will review and verify the report within 48 hours of receipt.
    - Upon verification, appropriate actions will be taken based on the severity of the violation (warning, removal of content, temporary ban from participation, permanent ban).
    - The outcome will be communicated privately to both the violator and the reporter (content involving privacy will not be made public).
3.  **Appeal**: If a violator disagrees with the outcome, they may appeal via the aforementioned reporting email within 72 hours. The core maintainers will review the case again and issue a final decision.

## Revision Note
This Code of Conduct will be continuously optimized as the community evolves. Revisions will be updated in the project repository and announced via community channels.
